// Only two of the round's requirements can be judged from a single play.
//
// The mod requirement has two special values:
//   'FM' (Free Mods) — any combination of mods is allowed. Every play passes.
//   All other values — every required acronym must be present in the play's mods.
//
// The challenge requirement splits. 'Full Combo' is absolute — this play either
// dropped no combo or it did. The other three ('Top #1 Score', 'Best Accuracy',
// 'Lowest Miss Count') are RELATIVE: they are decided by comparing every play in the
// round, so no single insert can know the answer. For those, qualifying means the play
// counts toward the challenge at all — right mods — and the ordering below is what
// expresses the requirement. 002_challenge_scores.sql's comment says qualified is
// "computed on insert", which is only true in that reading of it.
//
// A caveat worth keeping honest: a true Full Combo means no misses AND no dropped
// slider ends. The columns here record misses, not combo, so misses === 0 is the
// checkable approximation. Recording the beatmap's max combo would be needed to do
// better, and nothing stores it.
